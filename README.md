# Fastfeet

This project simulates a small delivery service with the following structure:
- [Node.js backend](https://github.com/ivanseibel/fastfeet/tree/master/backend): business rules, data persistence, interface with external services and a queue to serialize non-priority jobs.
- [ReactJS frontend](https://github.com/ivanseibel/fastfeet/tree/master/frontend): web interface to manage deliveries, deliveries and recipients.
- React Native mobile: mobile interface where delivery personnel can view their deliveries and update their status.
