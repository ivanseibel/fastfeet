# Fastfeet

This project simulates a small delivery service with the following structure:
- Node.js: business rules, data persistence, interface with external services and a queue to serialize non-priority jobs.
- ReactJS: web interface to manage deliveries, deliveries and recipients.
- React Native: mobile interface where delivery personnel can view their deliveries and update their status.

### Status: under construction :construction: :construction_worker:
